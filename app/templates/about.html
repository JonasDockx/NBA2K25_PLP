    <h1>About NBA 2K25 Player Progression System</h1>
    <p>
        A while ago, I found <strong><a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/rustyhwe/" target="_blank">u/ustyhews's</a></strong> thread on <strong><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NBA2k/comments/xl11pq/player_lock_progression_system/" target="_blank">a Player Lock Progression System</a></strong> for playing MyLeague as a single player in NBA 2K23. It turned out to be much more fun and less tedious than playing MyCareer. In this system, a player grows more organically, and you don't have to spend hours in the City/Neighbourhood/Boat like you do in MyCareer.
    </p>
    <p>
        Since I'm learning Python programming, I decided to take <strong><a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/rustyhwe/" target="_blank">u/ustyhews's</a></strong> logic and convert it into this website, using Python and flask. This version, NBA 2K25 Player Progression tracker, is based on that same logic, and Iâ€™ve extended it with more features, a better user interface, and customization options. 
    </p>
    <p>
        The rough idea is that upgrading is more related to your performances in-game. The better you perform in-game, the more points you can spend on upgrading attributes and badges.
    </p>
    <p>
        The program has a simple interface, and everything can be tracked in just a couple of screens:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li><a href="{{ url_for('dashboard') }}">Dashboard</a>: The starting screen. You can create new players, input game statistics for existing players or upgrade attributes or badges.</li>
        <li><a href="{{ url_for('add_player') }}">Create a New player</a>: You can add a new player to track here.</li>
        <li><a href="{{ url_for('input_stats') }}">Inputting Game Statistics</a>: Enter stats after every game or award to generate development and badge points.</li>
        <li><a href="{{ url_for('upgrade_attribute') }}">Spending Points on Attributes and Badges</a>: Upgrade your player's attributes and badges with the points you've earned in game.</li>
        <li><a href="{{ url_for('profile') }}">Profile administration</a>: Change your password, delete your account or customise the points earning system here.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        Everything you need can be found on this website.
    </p>
    <p>
        Feel free to try it out, suggest improvements, or contribute in any way. All feedback and help are greatly appreciated!
