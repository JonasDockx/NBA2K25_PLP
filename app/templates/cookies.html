        <p>This Cookie Policy explains what cookies are, which cookies we use on <strong><a href="https://www.nba2kpt.com" target="_blank">www.nba2kpt.com</a></strong> (the “Site”), why we use them, and how you can control them.</p>

        <h2>1. What Are Cookies?</h2>
        <p>Cookies are small text files that are placed on your device (computer, smartphone, tablet) when you visit websites. They help websites function properly, remember your preferences, and understand how visitors use the site.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>2. Types of Cookies We Use</h2>
        <p>At this time, we only use strictly necessary cookies on our Site. These are essential for the basic operation of our services and cannot be turned off without affecting core website functionality.</p>
        <h3>Strictly Necessary Cookies:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Purpose:</strong> These cookies enable essential features such as user authentication, maintaining sessions, and ensuring security. Without these cookies, key functions of the Site (like logging in or navigating between pages) may not work correctly.</li>
            <li><strong>Examples:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Session Cookies:</strong> Help us recognize you as you move between pages, keeping you logged in, and enabling secure account management.</li>
                    <li><strong>Security Cookies:</strong> Help prevent fraudulent activity and protect your data.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>3. No Non-Essential Cookies</h2>
        <p>We do not currently use any cookies for analytics, advertising, or personalization purposes. This means we are not placing cookies that track your browsing behavior beyond what is strictly necessary, nor are we using cookies to serve targeted advertisements.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>4. How We Use the Information from Cookies</h2>
        <p>Because we only use essential cookies, we do not engage in profiling or tracking beyond your current session. The information collected by these essential cookies is limited to ensuring you can securely log into your account and use the Site’s core features.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>5. Cookie Lifespan</h2>
        <p><strong>Session Cookies:</strong> These generally expire at the end of your browser session (when you close your browser) or after a short period. We do not store any long-term or persistent cookies beyond what is required for security and session management.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>6. Managing Cookies</h2>
        <p>Because we only use strictly necessary cookies, disabling them may prevent certain features of our Site from working properly. If you choose to adjust your browser’s cookie settings to block or remove cookies, some parts of the Site may become inaccessible or may not function as intended.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>7. Legal Basis for Using Cookies</h2>
        <p>Under applicable data protection laws (including the GDPR), consent is not required for placing strictly necessary cookies that are essential for the provision of our services. We rely on our legitimate interests and/or the performance of a contract to place these essential cookies. If we later introduce any non-essential cookies, we will request your explicit consent before setting them.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>8. Changes to This Cookie Policy</h2>
        <p>We may update this Cookie Policy from time to time to reflect changes in our use of cookies, data protection regulations, or best practices. Any updates will be effective upon posting. We encourage you to review this Cookie Policy periodically to stay informed about our use of cookies.</p>
